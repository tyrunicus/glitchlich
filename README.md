# glitchlich
Some NSIS installer I made to automate the installation of the Lich Project, eventually paired with Genie. It's got no error handling, but she's like a ship called the Fool's Gold. Loyal, flawed, mine.

#####GLITCHLICH INSTALLER######

This installer set ups the following, silently where possible:

Simutronics Game Laucher
Ruby 2.0.0-p648 + DevKit
SQLite

Lich into the Program Files\LichProject\Lich folder, with admin rights, and a shortcut on the desktop for the .rbw file.

And fails horribly to install all the GTK2 dependencies. Luckily, the shortcut to Lich will usually finish up whatever I missed. Huzzah!
